## Description
The purpose I set this project is to let starter learns how to build a PWA using Polymer component and Firebase, so you may not use the code for commercial use. 
Of course, I am a beginner as well and I am happy to see your suggestions or feedbacks. 
As this project has ended and I have 3 more new project on going, I would not update this project frequently 
(but I will if I receive you guys feedback :)

The project use Polymer 2.0 as the framework and holds the app on the Firebase server. Data is open for free
## Deployment Guide
To pull it from GitHub run >git pull

Once you pull or download this project from Github, it automatically has the access of the Firebase database,
so do not worry about the server.

To serve it on your local machine run: $ firebase serve

Then it will run on the http://localhost:5000 (depends on your system)

If you want to build your own database you need to login to [firebase console]( https://console.firebase.google.com/) 
and create a project, there is a detailed guid 
on the firebase doc. Please post a comment if want further description.
